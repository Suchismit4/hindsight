This file defines the `Broker` class, which is responsible for simulating the execution of trades within the
Hindsight backtesting environment. The `Broker` class manages the account, executes orders, and tracks
account throughout the simulation.

The `Broker` class serves as the intermediary between the trading strategy and the simulated market environment.
It takes trade orders generated by the strategy and executes them under the simulated market conditions,
accounting for factors such as transaction costs, slippage, and order delays. The broker also maintains the
state of the portfolio, including cash balances, positions, and performance metrics.

The `Broker` class operates within the Hindsight simulation loop, executing trades in sync with the daily
processing of market data. Each time the simulation advances a day, the broker processes any outstanding
orders and updates the portfolio accordingly. The class is designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing
for different types of order execution strategies, such as market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders.
