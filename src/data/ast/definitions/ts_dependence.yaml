# Time Series Dependence Examples
# These formulas demonstrate how one formula can use the result of another formula as a dataarray variable

# Simple base formula using price momentum
ts_momentum:
  description: "Simple time series momentum (current price / price from 5 periods ago - 1)"
  expression: "$price / shift($price, 5) - 1"
  return_type: "dataarray"
  variables:
    price:
      type: "dataarray"
      description: "Price series"

# Formula that depends on ts_momentum as a time series
ts_signal:
  description: "Scaled momentum signal based on ts_momentum"
  expression: "$ts_momentum * 2.0"
  return_type: "dataarray"
  variables:
    ts_momentum:
      type: "dataarray"
      description: "Price momentum from ts_momentum formula"

# Formula combining functional and time series dependence
ts_combined:
  description: "Combined signal using RSI and time series momentum"
  expression: "$ts_signal + rsi($price, 14)"
  return_type: "dataarray"
  variables:
    ts_signal:
      type: "dataarray"
      description: "Signal from ts_signal formula"
    price:
      type: "dataarray"
      description: "Price series"
